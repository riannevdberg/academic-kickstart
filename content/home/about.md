# About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning at the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Prof. Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/).
My main research interest is deep generative modeling from a probabilistic point of view. In particular, I work on variational inference, 
normalizing flows and generative adversarial networks. Recently, I also became interested in deep learning for dynamical systems described by differential equations. 
I am also interested in deep learning for graph-based data.
