abstract = "Pairing correlations in the even-even A = 102 âˆ’ 130 Sn isotopes are discussed, based on the Richardson-Gaudin variables in an exact Woods-Saxon plus reduced BCS pairing framework. The integrability of the model sheds light on the pairing correlations, in particular on the previously reported sub-shell structure."
